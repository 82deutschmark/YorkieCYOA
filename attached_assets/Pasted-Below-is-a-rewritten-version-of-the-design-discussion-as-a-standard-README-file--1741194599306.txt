# YorkieIG App

## Overview

YorkieIG App is designed to promote and sell Yorkshire Terrier artwork on Instagram. This application allows you to input image URLs of your Yorkie artwork, automatically generate an art style description, create a unique name and short narrative using the OpenAI API, and then post the final content on Instagram with a predefined set of hashtags.

## Features

- **Image Input:**  
  Accepts one or more image URLs representing your Yorkshire Terrier artwork.

- **OpenAI API Integration:**  
  Uses the OpenAI API to:
  - Generate a description of the image's art style.
  - Create a unique name.
  - Craft a brief narrative about the artwork.

- **Hashtag Management:**  
  Maintains a predefined list of hashtags that can be updated as needed to accompany each post.

- **Instagram API Integration:**  
  Automates the creation and publishing of posts on Instagram. This includes secure authentication, rate limit management, and error handling.

- **Logging and Analytics:**  
  Logs interactions with APIs and posting activity to support troubleshooting and provide usage analytics.

## Design Considerations

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  The project is structured into distinct modules:
  - Input handling.
  - OpenAI API processing.
  - Hashtag management.
  - Instagram posting.
  
  This modular design facilitates future enhancements and easier maintenance.

- **Security:**  
  Sensitive credentials, such as API keys, are stored in environment variables and secured using best practices. All external communications are conducted via secure protocols.

- **User Experience:**  
  Provides a minimal user interface that displays progress updates and error messages clearly and concisely.

- **Scalability:**  
  The architecture supports future improvements, including post scheduling, multi-platform support, and maintaining a history of posts.

- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive unit and integration tests are implemented to validate API responses, ensure proper error handling, and verify the reliability of the post publishing process.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure your environment:
   - Set up environment variables for your OpenAI API key, Instagram API credentials, and any additional sensitive information.
4. Run the application.

## Usage

- Provide one or more image URLs of your Yorkie artwork.
- The application will generate an art style description, unique name, and narrative using the OpenAI API.
- Predefined hashtags will be appended to the generated content.
- The final content is posted to your Instagram account automatically.
- Logs are maintained for API interactions and post activities to help with troubleshooting.
